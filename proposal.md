# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Rogue-like Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A rogue-like game where the goal is to survive as long as you can.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project will be based on the how to create a 2D Roguelike on Unity. It will share the same features with the end result of the tutorial as well as new some new features such as health. The program will be executed using the Unity engine.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
None

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Create the same program that is shown in the tutorial

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Add on the additional features to the program.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Make the game more complex. For example, more variation in how each stage will be randomly generated.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
First I will need to create the same game that is shown in the tutorial. In the process, I need to become more comfortable with using Unity and likely will need to look up how to implement my own features. Next, I would have to add the additional features into the game. If I am able to, I will make the features created in the tutorial more complex.
